# Coppa - Claude Code Instructions

## Project Overview

Coppa is an open-source OFDM digital modem for amateur radio, written in Rust and published as a **reference implementation** of an HF modem's DSP/FEC/protocol stack. It includes a full DSP chain, a protocol stack with ARQ, an AFSK 1200/AX.25 TNC, CLI tools, a daemon, C FFI bindings, and a VARA-style TCP control interface (modeled on VARA's TCP TNC API; the modem is **not** RF/waveform-compatible with VARA and does not interoperate with it).

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
# Build
cargo build --workspace

# Fast tests (lib-only, used in CI)
cargo test --workspace --lib

# Full test suite (includes integration + proptest — run before pushing)
cargo test --workspace

# With feature flags
cargo test --workspace --features cpal-backend,websocket --lib

# Clippy (CI runs with -D warnings)
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Format check
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# Benchmarks
cargo bench --workspace
```

## Testing Policy

**Always run `cargo test --workspace` locally before pushing.** The full test suite (integration tests, proptest roundtrips) is not run in CI to save GitHub Actions minutes. At minimum, run `cargo test --workspace --lib` for quick feedback.

## Workspace Structure

12 crates under `crates/`:

| Crate | Role |
|-------|------|
| `coppa-dsp` | Pure DSP: FFT, filters, AGC, resampling |
| `coppa-codec` | Modulation: BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, QAM, OFDM |
| `coppa-protocol` | Framing, FEC (convolutional + LDPC), ARQ, compression, sessions |
| `coppa-channel` | Channel models for testing (AWGN, fading, CFO) |
| `coppa-audio` | Audio backends: CPAL (feature-gated), WAV file I/O |
| `coppa-radio` | Radio control via rigctld CAT |
| `coppa-ml` | Channel prediction, MCS selection |
| `coppa-engine` | Core engine: thin wrapper around CoppaTransceiver |
| `coppa-host` | VARA-style TCP control server, WebSocket JSON API |
| `coppa-ffi` | C FFI (cdylib + staticlib) with streaming decode |
| `coppa-cli` | CLI binary (`coppa`) |
| `coppa-daemon` | Daemon binary (`coppad`) |

## Key Architecture

- **CoppaTransceiver** (in `coppa-protocol`) composes CoppaModem + LDPC + constellation mappers + block interleaver. This is the main encode/decode pipeline.
- **CoppaCore** (in `coppa-engine`) is a thin ~210-line wrapper around CoppaTransceiver.
- **9 speed levels** replace old mcs_index/fec_rate/modulation config. All profiles unified at 48kHz sample rate.
- FFI uses pointer-to-pointer semantics in `coppa_engine_destroy` to prevent double-free.

## CI

Single workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on push/PR to main:
- `cargo check`, `cargo test --lib` (with features), clippy, fmt, MSRV (1.85.0), platform checks (Linux/macOS/Windows), security audit.

## MSRV

1.85.0 (enforced in CI and `Cargo.toml`).

## Known Limitations

- No CFO (carrier frequency offset) tolerance in OFDM sync
- PAPR clipping too aggressive for speed levels 7-9 (higher-order QAM)
- Daemon hardware audio requires the `cpal-backend` feature; without it the daemon runs but moves no audio
- WebSocket server lacks integration tests
- Channel adaptation is EWMA-only; there is no ML model loading or inference (the `coppa-ml` model registry always falls back to EWMA)
- `coppa-channel` models AWGN + a two-tap Watterson/ITU-R F.1487 HF channel (Rayleigh taps, Gaussian Doppler). The sinusoidal `fading()` helper is AGC-test-only.
